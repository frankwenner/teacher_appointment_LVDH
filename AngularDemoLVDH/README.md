# AngularDemoLVDH

The first thing you have to do is use the command line terminal and use some commands to setup the example project.

1. Type 'cd AngularDemoLVDH/' => Navigates to the example project directory
2. Type 'npm install' => Installs the necessary dependencies in the example project
3. Type 'ng serve' => Starts the application

Your example project should now be running and be displayed on the right side of your browser.
There is a known Bug when using the Firefox or Chrome browser that will break angulars change detection when saving your changes. You can use Edge to avoid this otherwise you have to hit CTRL + C in the command line terminal every time you want to see your changes and then type 'ng serve' again.

## ToDo Task

Your task is to implement the .NET teacher-student-communication example using the learned principle of the angular Input and Output decorator. Your tasks are marked with a ToDo in the files teacher.componnent.ts / teacher-appointment.component.html.
If you need help feel free to ask the mentor of your current group.

## Advanced ToDo

You might have noticed that the student component is not yet implemented. Try using the principles that Maximilian explained to you in the angular basis workshop aswell as the principle explained here to implement the student component on your own and let it display data that you feed it from the parent and send some data back to the parent to display it there.
